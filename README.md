# Toornament Client

A java api client for Toornament. V2 of the api is still being developed.


## Add to Maven:
To use the current master branch in your project, add this to your pom.xml
```
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>

	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.BrentonPoke</groupId>
	    <artifactId>ToornamentClient</artifactId>
	    <version>-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
```
This will add a snapshot of the current master to your classpath. Note that this will update very regularly, and can break. Use with caution, not recommended for production systems quite yet!
